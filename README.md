# Scraping-and-Analyzing-Data-Analyst-Jobs-Descriptions-on-Indeed.com

Overview:
For this project, I wanted to analyze all remote entry level Data Analyst jobs descriptions on Indeed.com in order to get a glimpse of the most frequent Data Analysis tools required in remote entry level jobs, which is probably the best & easiest choice for anyone interested in gaining some work experience in order to get into the vast field of Data Science.
My intended audience is people interested in getting an entry level job in the field of Data Science & Analytics.

Description of the Data:
The data consists of exactly 229 distinct job descriptions (after cleaning) for remote entry level data analyst jobs on Indeed.com, I scraped the data from the website and saved it into a csv file "jobs_describtions.csv (1 column & 229 rows dataframe with the job description ‘string’ attribute).
The attributes I'm interested in visualizing are all derived from the job description texts and are all centered around the Data Analysis tools mentioned in these texts (frequency, associations, etc).
